# Dice-Rolling-Game

The Dice Rolling Game is a fun and simple program where the player rolls a virtual dice. Instead of a real dice, the computer randomly generates a number between 1 and 6, just like a real six-sided dice.

When the user starts the game, they can press a key (like Enter) to roll the dice. The program then displays the random number. Some versions also show dice faces using special symbols or text art to make it look more realistic.

This game is commonly created by beginners in Python to practice:

Random number generation using the random module.

Loops for rolling again and again until the user wants to quit.

Input and output for interacting with the player.

For example:

The player runs the game.

The computer rolls the dice and shows a number (1–6).

The player decides whether to roll again or exit.

It’s a short project but helps learners understand how random numbers work in Python and how to keep repeating a task using loops.
